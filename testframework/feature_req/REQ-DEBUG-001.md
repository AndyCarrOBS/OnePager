# Div Lines Feature Toggle - Requirements

## Feature: Admin Panel Div Lines Toggle

As an administrator
I want to toggle the Div Lines feature on and off
So that I can control the visual display of construction lines on the website

## Background:
Given the admin panel is accessible
And the Div Lines feature is currently disabled

## Scenario: Enable Div Lines Feature

**Given** I am on the admin panel page
**When** I toggle the "Div Lines" switch to ON
**Then** the switch should show as enabled (purple background)
**And** the status badge should display "ON"
**And** the change should be saved to the database
**And** I should see a "Changes saved successfully!" message

## Scenario: Disable Div Lines Feature

**Given** I am on the admin panel page
**And** the Div Lines feature is currently enabled
**When** I toggle the "Div Lines" switch to OFF
**Then** the switch should show as disabled (gray background)
**And** the status badge should display "OFF"
**And** the change should be saved to the database
**And** I should see a "Changes saved successfully!" message

## Scenario: View Div Lines Effect on Main Site

**Given** I have toggled the Div Lines feature in the admin panel
**When** I navigate to the main website
**And** I reload the page
**Then** I should see the visual effect of the Div Lines feature
**And** the effect should match the current toggle state

## Scenario: Persistent Feature State

**Given** I have changed the Div Lines feature state in the admin panel
**When** I close the browser and return later
**And** I navigate to the admin panel
**Then** the Div Lines toggle should display the previously saved state
**And** the feature should maintain its enabled/disabled status
